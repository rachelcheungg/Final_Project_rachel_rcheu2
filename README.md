This project is a Django-based web application designed to streamline the apartment hunting and subleasing process for users. 
The goal is to create a centralized platform where users can browse available apartment complexes, view their locations on an 
interactive map, post their own subleases, and track personal savings goals related to renting or furnishing an apartment.
