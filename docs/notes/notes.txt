Ideas & Selection Rationale:
* Final Project Ideas:
    * hangout place ranker
        - rate places users have been with friends
        - community feed (like Instagram FYP)
        - users can post throughts and their review of the place
    * boredom website
        - users can generate a task to do when they're bored
        - live task exchange feature where two users can give each other a task to complete
        - random task generator can also give more personalized recommendations based on location or personal preferences
        - users can rate the task (was it boring? fun?)
For the final project, I will do the boredom website.
I think it would be a fun app to build.

Wireframe Notes:
I only have an idea for the homepage currently.
On the homepage, there are two buttons.
One for randomly generating a task from a database and one for getting a task from another user.
For a randomly generated task, users have the option to choose which category (e.g., outdoors, indoors, quiet, adventurous) and what type (productive or fun) of task it is.

Branching Strategy:
I chose to use the GitHub Flow branching strategy because it keeps things simple.
There will be a main branch and a features branch.
Each feature will generally be the assignment for the week.

Branch Usage Reflections:
I named my branch "features" for the time being since we're just getting started.
I was able to create, commit, and push without any issues.
