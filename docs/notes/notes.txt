Ideas & Selection Rationale:
* Final Project Ideas:
    * hangout place ranker
        - rate places users have been with friends
        - community feed (like Instagram FYP)
        - users can post throughts and their review of the place
    * boredom website
        - users can generate a task to do when they're bored
        - live task exchange feature where two users can give each other a task to complete
        - random task generator can also give more personalized recommendations based on location or personal preferences
        - users can rate the task (was it boring? fun?)
For the final project, I will do the boredom website.
I think it would be a fun app to build.
